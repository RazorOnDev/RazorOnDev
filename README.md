# Razor
Hello, welcome to my github profile, my real name is √Ålex and I'm 16 y/o and I'm also from Spain. 
I have a passion for software development and coding, specially in AI, data science, and backend features using Python.

My skills also include app development through React Native Framework using Javascript. But I'm actually 100% focused on Python and learning more about AI.

Visit my portfolio if you want to know more about me and to see all my personal projects.
